# @portive/auth

To use the Portive Client or a Portive enabled component like **Slate Cloud**, **Plate Cloud** or **Wysimark Cloud**, you must provide an **API key** or an **Auth Token** (which is generated from an API Key) to the component.

Using the API Key directly is an easier way to start and is great for development. Using an auth token is more secure but takes a little more work to setup.

This library lets you generate Auth Tokens from a Portive API Key.
